Title: Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide Fractions
Difficulty: 5
Description: This project involves working with fractions. How do you add 1⁄3 + 1⁄5? Create a program that first asks the user which operation they want to do: add, subtract, multiply or divide and then asks for 1, 2 or more fractions to work with. The program prints out the result.
Tips: Think about how you might divide up the fraction itself into its numerator and denominator. Many of the operations involve finding a common denominator, getting its reciprocal and possibly reducing a fraction to lowest terms. This would be much easier if you can isolate the numerator from its denominator. You could also do this using a custom fraction class.
Added Difficulty: Try working with mixed, improper, or complex fractions.


分数的加减乘除

这个项目包含分数的计算。创建一个程序可以首先问用户要执行什么运算然后添加分数进行运算，程序打印出结果。
小贴士：你会怎样分离分数的分子和分母呢，通常的做法包括找到一个公约数，取倒数，尽可能把分数约分到最小。如果你可以分离分子和分母这件事将会变得简单。你也可以自定义分数类来处理。
